Looking for a simple way to check for support of SPF, DKIM and DMARC

SPF Record Check: nslookup -type=txt mydomain.com
DKIM Record Check: nslookup -type=txt selector._domainkey.example.com
DMARC Record Check: nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.example.com

## But what if we could automate this?

Lets explore the options in Python using dns.resolver

Install the dnspython library if you donâ€™t have it already

pip install dnspython
